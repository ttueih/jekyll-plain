# Enable collections
# you can add more collection or remove collection by configuring the below variables.
# It is important that you keep 'tags' collection in order to let tag system work.
collections:
  tags:
    output: true

    # For tags collection: each new tag will need a file with the same name in `_tags' folder. Just follow the format of the other tag files, such as `_tags/markdown.rm`.
  pages:
    # all post inside _pages folder will be long to this collection.
    output: true
    permalink: /:collection/:name
